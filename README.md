# Misinformation Spread Monte Carlo Simulation in Social Networks
Developed by Akanksha Agrawal and Sara Kiel as a Final Project in Spring 2025 for IS597PR - Programming and Quality in Analytics. Course taught by John Weible. 

## Overview
This project simulates the spread of fake and factual news across a synthetic social network using Monte Carlo methods. Agents represent social media users, each assigned roles such as influencers, fact-checkers, susceptible users, or regular users. The goal is to model how misinformation diffuses through a realistic social graph and to evaluate how different conditions—like user type distribution, trust, and fact-checking interventions—affect the reach and speed of information.
